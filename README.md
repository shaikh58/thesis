# thesis
This repository contains my final thesis document, the paper that my team successfully submitted (it has also been accepted) at the REMOO2017 conference, as well as the Python code that I wrote as part of the project. Note that the paper we published does not have the latest results - further work yielded much better results, which can be found in my actual thesis document. These results will be presented at the conference in May, but will not appear in the publication.
